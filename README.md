## Udemy gRPC [Node JS] Masterclass: Build Modern API & Microservices :: IN-PROGRESS
Instructor: Stephane Maarek
###### Overview
This course goes over the a new modern api microservice architecutre called gRPC. The course goes indepth into gRPC and implementing it in Node JS. Personally I love the simplicity of gRPC, and for me its more logical to implement this then a ORM with a REST API, or even just a REST API. I can easily see this become the future just becuase of its simplicity and ease of configuration.
