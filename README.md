## Udemy C++ Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond
Instructor: Frank Mitropoulos
###### Overview
I bought this course to help refresh/harden my knowldege on C++. Most of my College degree has had some sort of C++ in the class, but I found that I wasn't perfect when it came to discussing even jsut the basics. I knew how to program in C++ and do even data structures in C++ but some of the basics I missed or I felt I didn't know it as well as I wanted. I prett much flew through this course but it was helpful in refreshing my knowledge.

Instructor: Stephane Maarek
###### Overview
This course goes over the a new modern api microservice architecutre called gRPC. The course goes indepth into gRPC and implementing it in Node JS.

I can easily see this become the future just becuase of its simplicity and ease of configuration.
